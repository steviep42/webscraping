<h2><span class="header-section-number">1.1</span> Lots of Data For The Taking ?</h2>
<p>The web hosts lots of interesting data that you can ”scrape”. Some of it is stashed in data bases, behind APIs, or in free form text. Lots of people want to grab information of of Twitter or from user forums to see what people are thinking. There is a lot of valuable information out there for the taking although some web sites have “caught on” and either block programmatic access or they setup “pay walls” that require you to subscribe to an API for access. The New York Times does this. But there are lots of opportunities to get data.</p>

<h2><span class="header-section-number">1.2</span> Web Scraping Can Be Ugly</h2>
<p>Depending on what web sites you want to scrape the process can be involved and quite tedious. Many websites are very much aware that people are scraping so they offer Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) to make requests for information easier for the user and easier for the server administrators to control access. Most times the user must apply for a “key” to gain access. For premium sites, the key costs money. Some sites like Google and Wunderground (a popular weather site) allow some number of free accesses before they start charging you. Even so the results are typically returned in XML or JSON which then requires you to parse the result to get the information you want. In the best situation there is an R package that will wrap in the parsing and will return lists or data frames.</p>
<p>Here is a summary:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>First. Always try to find an R package that will access a site (e.g. New York Times, Wunderground, PubMed). These packages (e.g. omdbapi, easyPubMed, RBitCoin, rtimes) provide a programmatic search interface and return data frames with little to no effort on your part.</p></li>
<li><p>If no package exists then hopefully there is an API that allows you to query the website and get results back in JSON or XML. I prefer JSON because it’s “easier” and the packages for parsing JSON return lists which are native data structures to R. So you can easily turn results into data frames. You will ususally use the <em>rvest</em> package in conjunction with XML, and the RSJONIO packages.</p></li>
<li><p>If the Web site doesn’t have an API then you will need to scrape text. This isn’t hard but it is tedious. You will need to use <em>rvest</em> to parse HMTL elements. If you want to parse mutliple pages then you will need to use <em>rvest</em> to move to the other pages and possibly fill out forms. If there is a lot of Javascript then you might need to use RSelenium to programmatically manage the web page.</p></li>

<div id="understanding-the-language-of-the-web" class="section level2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">1.3</span> Understanding The Language of The Web</h2>

<p>So to be productive at scraping requires you to have some familiarity with HMTL XML, and CSS. Here we look at a very basic HTML file. Refer to See <a href="http://bradleyboehmke.github.io/2015/12/scraping-html-text.html" class="uri">http://bradleyboehmke.github.io/2015/12/scraping-html-text.html</a> for a basic introductory session on HTML and webscraping with R</p>

<h3><span class="header-section-number">1.3.1</span> Useful tools</h3>
<p>There are a number of tools that allow us to inspect web pages and see “what is under the hood”. Warning - I just discovered that one of my favorite browser plugins (firebug) to find the xpaths and/or css paths of page elements is no longer supported under Firefox or Chrome. I’ve found a couple of replacements but they don’t work as well. I’ll research it more. The way that <strong>Selector Gadget</strong> and <strong>xPath</strong> work is that you install them into your browswer and then activate them whenever you need to identify the <strong>selector</strong> associated with a part of a web page.</p>

<p>You will use the following three primary packages to help you get data from various web pages: <em>rvest</em>, <em>XML</em>, and <em>RJSONIO</em>. Note that you won’t always use them simultaneously but you might use them in pairs or individually depending on the task at hand.</p>

<p>Now let’s do a quick <em>rvest</em> tutorial. There are several steps involved in using <strong>rvest</strong> which are conceptually quite straightforward:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Identify a URL to be examined for content</li>
<li>Use Selector Gadet, xPath, or Google Insepct to identify the “selector” This will be a paragraph, table, hyper links, images</li>
<li>Load rvest</li>
<li>Use <strong>read_html</strong> to “read” the URL</li>
<li>Pass the result to <strong>html_nodes</strong> to get the selectors identified in step number 2</li>
<li>Get the text or table content</li>

##  [3] &quot;In demographics, the world population is the total number of humans currently living, and was estimated to have reached 7.7 billion people as of November 2018.[1] It took over 200,000 years of human history for the world&#39;s population to reach 1 billion;[2] and only 200 years more to reach 7 billion.[3]&quot;                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                
##  [4] &quot;World population has experienced continuous growth since the end of the Great Famine of 1315–1317 and the Black Death in 1350, when it was near 370 million.[4] \nThe highest population growth rates – global population increases above 1.8% per year – occurred between 1955 and 1975, peaking to 2.06% between 1965 and 1970.[5] The growth rate has declined to 1.18% between 2010 and 2015 and is projected to decline further in the course of the 21st century.[5]&quot;                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     
##  [5] &quot;Total annual births were highest in the late 1980s at about 139 million,[6] and as of 2011 were expected to remain essentially constant at a level of 135 million,[7] while deaths numbered 56 million per year and were expected to increase to 80 million per year by 2040.[8] \nThe median age of the world&#39;s population was estimated to be 30.4 years in 2018.[9]&quot;                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         
##  [6] &quot;Six of the Earth&#39;s seven continents are permanently inhabited on a large scale. Asia is the most populous continent, with its 4.54 billion inhabitants accounting for 60% of the world population. The world&#39;s two most populated countries, China and India, together constitute about 36% of the world&#39;s population. Africa is the second most populated continent, with around 1.28 billion people, or 16% of the world&#39;s population. Europe&#39;s 742 million people make up 10% of the world&#39;s population as of 2018, while the Latin American and Caribbean regions are home to around 651 million (9%). Northern America, primarily consisting of the United States and Canada, has a population of around 363 million (5%), and Oceania, the least populated region, has about 41 million inhabitants (0.5%).[11] Though it is not permanently inhabited by any fixed population, Antarctica has a small, fluctuating international population based mainly in polar science stations. This population tends to rise in the summer months and decrease significantly in winter, as visiting researchers return to their home countries.[12]&quot;
##  [7] &quot;Estimates of world population by their nature are an aspect of modernity, possible only since the Age of Discovery. Early estimates for the population of the world[14] date to the 17th century: William Petty in 1682 estimated world population at  320 million (modern estimates ranging close to twice this number); by the late 18th century, estimates ranged close to one billion (consistent with modern estimates).[15] More refined estimates, broken down by continents, were published in the first half of the 19th century, at 600 to 1000 million in the early 1800s and at 800 to 1000 million in the 1840s.[16]&quot;                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              
##  [8] &quot;It is difficult for estimates to be better than rough approximations, as even modern population estimates are fraught with uncertainties on the order of 3% to 5%.[17]&quot;                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         
##  [9] &quot;Estimates of the population of the world at the time agriculture emerged in around 10,000 BC have ranged between 1 million and 15 million.[18][19]  Even earlier, genetic evidence suggests humans may have gone through a population bottleneck of between 1,000 and 10,000 people about 70,000 BC, according to the Toba catastrophe theory. By contrast, it is estimated that around 50–60 million people lived in the combined eastern and western Roman Empire in the 4th century AD.[20]&quot;                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 
## [10] &quot;The Plague of Justinian, which first emerged during the reign of the Roman emperor Justinian, caused Europe&#39;s population to drop by around 50% between the 6th and 8th centuries AD.[21] The population of Europe was more than 70 million in 1340.[22] The Black Death pandemic of the 14th century may have reduced the world&#39;s population from an estimated 450 million in 1340 to between 350 and 375 million in 1400;[23] it took 200 years for population figures to recover.[24] The population of China decreased from 123 million in 1200 to 65 million in 1393,[25] presumably due to a combination of Mongol invasions, famine, and plague.[26]&quot;</code></pre>

<p>In the above example we leveraged the fact that we were looking specifically for a table element and it became a project to locate the correct table number. This isn’t always the case with more complicated websites in that the element we are trying to grab or scrape is contained within a nested structure that doesn’t correspond neatly to a paragraph, link, heading, or table. This can be the case if the page is heavily styled with CSS or Javascript. We might have to work harder. But it’s okay to try to use simple elements and then try to refine the search some more.</p>

<h2><span class="header-section-number">1.7</span> Scraping Patient Dialysis Stories</h2>
<p>Here is an example relating to the experiences of dialysis patients with a specific dialysis provider. It might be more useful to find a support forum that is managed by dialysis patients to get more general opinions but this example is helpful in showing you what is involved. Check out this website:</p>

<p>In looking at this page you will see that there are a number of patient stories. Actually, there is a summary line followed by a “Read More” link that provides more detail on the patient experience. Our goal is to get the full content as opposed to only the summary. How would we do this ?</p>

<p>Let’s use our new found knowledge of <strong>rvest</strong> to help us get these detailed stories. Maybe we want to do some sentiment analysis on this. If you hover over the <strong>Read More</strong> link on the website it will provide a specific link for each patient. For example,</p>

<p>What we want to do is first get a list of all these links from the main page after which we can loop over each of the patient specific links and capture that information into a vector. Each element of the vector will be the content of a specific patient’s story.</p>

<p>Next we will visit each of these pages and scrape the text information. We’ll step through this in class so you can see this in action but here is the code. We will get each story and place each paragrpah of the story into a vector element. After that we will eliminate blank lines and some junk lines that begin with a new line character.

##  [2] &quot;In April 2010, Randal Beatty was diagnosed with end stage renal disease (ESRD). The diagnosis came as a surprise, and, Mr. Beatty admits, he kept praying for a miracle.&quot;                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       
##  [3] &quot;“I heard all those stories about how people feel during dialysis and I didn’t want to deal with it,” said Mr. Beatty. “I didn’t want to lose my freedom and I certainly didn’t want to feel sick all the time.”&quot;                                                                                                                                                                                                                                
##  [4] &quot;So for three years, he waited, hoping to find his miracle. But by August 2013, he knew he waited too long.&quot;                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     
##  [5] &quot;“Before my first dialysis treatment, I could feel myself pulling away from everyone, especially my family. I didn’t want to go anywhere or do anything and I was sick all the time. I realized at that point that how I was feeling was exactly what I wanted to avoid.”&quot;                                                                                                                                                                       
##  [6] &quot;He began his in-center dialysis treatments with American Renal Associates (ARA) at University Kidney Center in Louisville, Kentucky in August 2013 and transferred to another local ARA facility – University Kidney Center Hikes Lane – in May 2014 since it was closer to his home.&quot;                                                                                                                                                          
##  [7] &quot;“In a short time, dialysis completely changed me,” he said. His health improved, along with his confidence, encouraging him to start driving himself to and from treatments. Not only did this give him a renewed feeling of independence, but a strong sense of accomplishment, as well.&quot;                                                                                                                                                      
##  [8] &quot;Now 67 years old, Mr. Beatty says he can do everything he did before, including keeping up with his two granddaughters, playing basketball, among other hobbies, and going on family vacations.

##  [2] &quot;In April 2010, Randal Beatty was diagnosed with end stage renal disease (ESRD). The diagnosis came as a surprise, and, Mr. Beatty admits, he kept praying for a miracle.&quot;                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       
##  [3] &quot;“I heard all those stories about how people feel during dialysis and I didn’t want to deal with it,” said Mr. Beatty. “I didn’t want to lose my freedom and I certainly didn’t want to feel sick all the time.”&quot;                                                                                                                                                                                                                                
##  [4] &quot;So for three years, he waited, hoping to find his miracle. But by August 2013, he knew he waited too long.&quot;                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     
##  [5] &quot;“Before my first dialysis treatment, I could feel myself pulling away from everyone, especially my family. I didn’t want to go anywhere or do anything and I was sick all the time. I realized at that point that how I was feeling was exactly what I wanted to avoid.”&quot;                                                                                                                                                                       
##  [6] &quot;He began his in-center dialysis treatments with American Renal Associates (ARA) at University Kidney Center in Louisville, Kentucky in August 2013 and transferred to another local ARA facility – University Kidney Center Hikes Lane – in May 2014 since it was closer to his home.&quot;                                                                                                                                                          
##  [7] &quot;“In a short time, dialysis completely changed me,” he said. His health improved, along with his confidence, encouraging him to start driving himself to and from treatments. Not only did this give him a renewed feeling of independence, but a strong sense of accomplishment, as well.&quot;                                                                                                                                                      
##  [8] &quot;Now 67 years old, Mr. Beatty says he can do everything he did before, including keeping up with his two granddaughters, playing basketball, among other hobbies, and going on family vacations. In fact, with the help of ARA’s Travel Department, Mr. Beatty can travel stress free. Though he admits traveling while on dialysis can be intimidating, he explained, “All I had to do was show up. ARA’s Travel Team took care of everything.”&quot;

<pre><code>## [1] &quot;Mr. Randal Beatty, University Kidney Center Hikes LaneIn April 2010, Randal Beatty was diagnosed with end stage renal disease (ESRD). The diagnosis came as a surprise, and, Mr. Beatty admits, he kept praying for a miracle.“I heard all those stories about how people feel during dialysis and I didn’t want to deal with it,” said Mr. Beatty. “I didn’t want to lose my freedom and I certainly didn’t want to feel sick all the time.”So for three years, he waited, hoping to find his miracle. But by August 2013, he knew he waited too long.“Before my first dialysis treatment, I could feel myself pulling away from everyone, especially my family. I didn’t want to go anywhere or do anything and I was sick all the time. I realized at that point that how I was feeling was exactly what I wanted to avoid.”He began his in-center dialysis treatments with American Renal Associates (ARA) at University Kidney Center in Louisville, Kentucky in August 2013 and transferred to another local ARA facility – University Kidney Center Hikes Lane – in May 2014 since it was closer to his home.“In a short time, dialysis completely changed me,” he said. His health improved, along with his confidence, encouraging him to start driving himself to and from treatments. Not only did this give him a renewed feeling of independence, but a strong sense of accomplishment, as well.Now 67 years old, Mr. Beatty says he can do everything he did before, including keeping up with his two granddaughters, playing basketball, among other hobbies, and going on family vacations. In fact, with the help of ARA’s Travel Department, Mr. Beatty can travel stress free. Though he admits traveling while on dialysis can be intimidating, he explained, “All I had to do was show up. ARA’s Travel Team took care of everything.”Receiving a diagnosis of ESRD can be challenging, but Mr. Beatty’s advice is to take a step back and see dialysis as the miracle it is.“It took me three years to realize that dialysis was the miracle I was waiting for. I was an extremely sick individual and just a few months on dialysis completely changed me. I don’t know why I waited as long as I did. I could have been enjoying life for the last few years rather than staying home sick. And I honestly haven’t been sick since I started my dialysis treatments!”Read more patient storiesAs of June 30, 2018American Renal Associates operates 233 dialysis clinics in 26 states and Washington, D.C., serving approximately 16,000 patients with end stage renal disease in partnership with approximately 400 local nephrologists.\r\nOur core values emphasize taking good care of patients, providing physicians with clinical autonomy and support, hiring the best possible staff and providing best practices management.&quot;</code></pre>
